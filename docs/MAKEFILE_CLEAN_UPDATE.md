# Makefile Clean Target Update

## Changes Made

The `make clean` target has been updated to remove all build artifacts including:

### Previous Behavior
- Removed `output/` directory
- Removed `install/` directory

### New Behavior
Now also removes:
- All `*.tar.gz` files (package archives)
- All `*.squashfs` files (extension filesystems)
- All `ext_monitoring*.zip` files
- All `ext_monitoring_install*.sh` scripts
- `PACKAGE_CONTENTS.txt`
- `BUILD_SUMMARY.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`

## Usage

```bash
# Remove all build artifacts and generated files
make clean

# Also remove downloaded binaries (complete reset)
make distclean
```

## Testing

```bash
# Before clean - list artifacts
ls -la *.tar.gz *.squashfs ext_monitoring*.sh 2>/dev/null

# Clean everything
make clean

# Verify removal
ls -la *.tar.gz *.squashfs ext_monitoring*.sh 2>/dev/null
# Should show: No such file or directory
```

## Benefits

1. **Clean Workspace**: Removes all generated files for a fresh start
2. **No Accumulation**: Prevents old packages from accumulating
3. **Consistent State**: Ensures clean builds without interference
4. **Storage Management**: Frees up disk space (packages can be 180MB+ each)

## Note

- `make clean` - Removes artifacts but keeps downloaded binaries
- `make distclean` - Complete reset, removes everything including downloads

This ensures a cleaner development workflow and prevents confusion from multiple package versions.
