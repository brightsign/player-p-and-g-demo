# Serial Connection from Player to Development Host

Serial communications is used to interrupt the boot cycle and insecure the player and for many other diagnostic situations. In this Spell, you will connect a player to your development host and verify the connection.

## Requirements

* A serial to USB cable or arrangement of adapters suitable for your player and development host.
* A serial monitor program on you development host (tested with picocom on Ubuntu 24.04)

1. Consult [Serial Port Configuration](https://docs.brightsign.biz/advanced/serial-port-configuration) for details and instruction about making the physical connection.  **NB**: some players (LS series) may require an additional adapater.

**Make the physical connection**

2. Verify the connection by checking the tty devices. You should see a device matching your connection.

```bash
# assuming the device connection is a USB adapter, most will show up like this
ls /dev/ttyUSB*
#/dev/ttyUSB0

# other common device enumerations include /dev/ttyACM* and /dev/ttyS*
```

For clarity and convenience, set an environment variable with the device file node:

```bash
# modify to use YOUR device
export player_serial_device=/dev/ttyUSB0
```

3. **POWER OFF THE PLAYER**
4. Monitor the serial port from the player

Using picocom (modify to use the terminal program of your choice)

```bash
picocom -b 115200 ${player_serial_device}
```

Nothing will happen yet as the player is powered off, right?

5. __WHILE HOLDING THE _SVC_ BUTTON__ power ON the player.

You should see something like:
_(details will vary based on your player)_
